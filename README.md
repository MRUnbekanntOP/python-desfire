DESFire
=========

Desfire card library for Python

Project still ongoing, use it with caution!

Features
========

-   Compatible with all readers supported by pySCARD

-   Pure python implementation

-   One of the few DESFire libraries that supports ALL (DES,2DES,3DES,AES)
    authentication types

-   Enumeration of the card gives an overlook on how the card is structured

-   Functions implement:

    -   authenticate
    -   communicate
    -   getApplicationIDs
    -   getKeySetting
    -   getCardVersion
    -   formatCard
    -   selectApplication
    -   createApplication
    -   deleteApplication
    -   getFileIDs
    -   getFileSettings
    -   readFileData
    -   writeFileData
    -   deleteFile
    -   createStdDataFile
    -   getKeyVersion
    -   changeKeySettings
    -   changeKey
    -   createKeySetting

Issues
======

-   Canâ€™t read data from certain file types
